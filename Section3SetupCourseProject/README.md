# Notes

- See "CourseProject" folder 
- Planning and setting up components - many ways to accomplish
    - Initially, I had a different setup, but in the end followed the instructor's lead to make future work easier
- Lots of layout decisions 
- A lot of Bootstrap classes used - need to take a course on that!
