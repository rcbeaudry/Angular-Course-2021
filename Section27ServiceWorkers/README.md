## Notes
- Another Bonus Module, from older code, requires back-end setup to run
- PWA => Progresive Web Application
- Hints:
    - Service worker runs on a separate thread from loaded JS attached to HTML pages
    - Manages all pages of a given scope
    - Can intercept outgoing requests, and manipulate (ex., cache pages, and provide when offline)
    - Acts like a proxy
    - ng add @angular/pwa - installs packages and gives pre-configures service worker
    - npm install -g http-server - installs lightweight node-based server
